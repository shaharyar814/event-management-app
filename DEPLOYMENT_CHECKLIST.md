## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

1. Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
2. Check linting errors: `npm run lint`
3. Verify all imports are correct
4. Check for missing dependencies
5. Check for framework version drift: `npm ls next react react-dom eslint-config-next`
6. Reinstall from lockfile if versions are stale: `npm ci`

### If Authentication Fails

1. Verify Supabase URL and keys in Vercel
2. Check Site URL in Supabase settings
3. Verify redirect URLs are configured
4. Test in incognito/private browsing

### If Database Connection Fails

1. Check environment variables in Vercel
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Test Supabase connection in dashboard
4. Check database schema is deployed

### If Pages Don't Load

1. Check Vercel function logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check for runtime errors in Vercel dashboard
4. Test health endpoint: `/api/health`

## 📊 Monitoring Setup
